# Credit-risk-modelling
The goal of the project is to predict whether a debtor will turn out to be a defaulter or not.
A dataset consisting of variables such as revolving utilization of unsecured lines, age, number of times 30-59 days past due worse,debtratio, monthly-income, number of open credits lines and loans, number of times 90 days late, Number of real estate lines and loans, number of times 60-80 days past due not worse, number of dependents was cleaned and analyzed using R.
Statistical Analysis was carried out including parametric testing suchs as t-test and ANOVA.
Supervised Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN,Linear Regression,Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest,SVM were implemented.
Tableau was used for generating visualizations and to draw inferences.


## Conclusion:
The accuracy of random forest is the highest.The sensitivity is very high whereas the specificity is very low.Therefore the model is more accurate for non-defaultesr than defaulters.The most important variables are revolving utilization of unsecured lines, debt ratio and monthly income and the least important variable is number of dependents.
